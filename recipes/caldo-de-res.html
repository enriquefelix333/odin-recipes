<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Caldo de res is a Mexican beef soup that's extremely hearty and satisfying. The hind shank flavors the broth beautifully as does the marrow in the bones. Garnish with slivered raw onion, lime juice, jalapeños, and more cilantro.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds beef shank, with bone</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>2 medium carrots, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>2 chayotes</li>
    <li>2 ears corn, husked and cut into thirds</li>
    <li>1 potato</li>
    <li>1 medium head cabbage, cored and cut into wedges</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapeños</li>
    <li>1/4cup finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 limes cut into wedges</li>
    <li>4 radishes, quartered</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the meat from the beef bones into about 1/2 inch pieces, leaving some on the bones.</li>
    <li>Heat a heavy soup pot over medium-high heat until very hot. Add oil, tilting the pan to coat the bottom. Add meat and bones and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until thoroughly browned.</li>
    <li>Add onion and cook until lightly browned; stir in broth and tomatoes. The liquid should cover the bones by 1/2 inch. If not, add some water to compensate. Reduce heat to low; simmer with the lid on loosely until meat is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Pour in 4 cups water, and return to a simmer. Add carrots and 1/4 cup cilantro, and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chayote, corn, and potato; simmer until vegetables are tender. Push cabbage wedges into soup; cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Ladle soup into large bowls, including some meat, vegetables, and bones. Garnish with cilantro, jalapeños, and minced onion. Squeeze lime juice over soup and serve with radishes.</li>
